# BLOG RUNNING FROM TERMINAL

This is a simple Blog engine running in terminal built based on the course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-web-course-learn-by-building-8-apps/ 

In this project i've built a simple blog posting system that:
- Set up a mongoDB database.
- Checks if the user exists in the database (if not it offeres a form to create the first blog).
- Asks the user whether he/she wants to Read or Write a blog.
- Based on the answer it enables Reading or Writing a new blog post.

Learnings:
 - creating project structure
 - Pyhon object oriented programming (OOP)
 - mongoDB
